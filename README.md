Music is an art and a universal language. It is a collection of notes of different frequencies. 
In this project, I have tried to develop a deep learning model that generates music on its own. 
The model was trained using a set of 65 tunes(in ABC notation) taken from the Nottingham Music Database. 
I have taken some parts of the model development code from <a target="_blank" href = "https://github.com/analytics-club-iitm/MiniProject-Music-Generation">here</a>.
The preprocessing step consisted of removing the metadata and extracting inputs and outputs from the database. 
I have used a series of LSTM layers along with Dropout.
